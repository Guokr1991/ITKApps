<h2>Section 6. Automatic Segmentation using Region Competition Snakes</h2>
<p>This section gives step by step instructions on segmenting an image using the region competition snake (in last section's terminology, snake evolution that uses the region feature image). This section assumes that you are working with the image <strong>MRIcrop-orig.gipl</strong>, as recommended in <a href="TutorialSectionLoadingImages.html#Download">Section 2, Step 1</a>. We will segment the caudate nucleus and the ventricles in this image. This section also assumes that you are using the label file <strong>MRIcrop-seg.label</strong>. </p>
<p>You can, however, follow the general directions of this section using a different image, but you will have to use your own judgement in selecting various parameters.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Step 1. Discard the Previous Segmentation.</h3>
<p>In <a href="TutorialSectionManualSegmentation.html">Section 4</a>, we have created a manual segmentation. In order to perform the segmentation automatically, we will  discard the manual segmetnation. This involves reloading the greyscale image. </p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>Select <strong>File | Load Data | Greyscale Image</strong>.</p>
    <p>Use the <strong>History</strong> button to select the image loaded most recently.</p>
    <p>Step through the rest of the wizard, as descibed in <a href="TutorialSectionLoadingImages.html#Orientation">Section 2</a>. </p></td>

<h3>Step 2. Select the Label to Use for Automatic Segmentation</h3>
<p>We will be segmenting the caudate nucleus. We have to make sure that the appropriate combination of the current drawing label and background (draw over) label is selected.</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>Make sure that the label <strong>&quot;caudates&quot;</strong> is selected as the current drawing label</p>
      <p>Make sure that <strong>&quot;All Labels&quot;</strong> is selected in the <strong>Draw over</strong> drop-down box. </p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconTip.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>The <strong>draw over</strong> label functions the same way in automatic segmentation as in manual segmentation. It lets you apply the results of automatic segmentation to all labels, to all visible labels, to the clear label, or to a particular label. This gives you a lot of creative control when segmenting multiple structures. For instance, to segment a structure that is embedded inside another structure, you can first segment the outer structure with label <strong>A</strong> and then segment the inner structure with label <strong>B</strong> and with the draw-over label set to <strong>A</strong>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

<h3>Step 3. Select the Region of Interest using the Snake Interaction Mode.</h3>
<p>The automatic segmentation component of SNAP requires a lot of computer resources. Both the amount of memory and the time required to compete a segmentation can be reduces by selecting a sub-region of the image on which to perform segmentation. In this step, we will select a subregion of the image that contains the caudate nucleus. </p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

<p align="left">As you select the snake tool, a pink-colored dashed <em>selection box </em>will appear at the border of the each slice in the slice windows, as shown below:</p>
<table width="10%"  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5">

    <td><img src="Artwork/ttRegionROISelection01.gif" width="218" height="212"></td>
    <td><img src="Artwork/ttRegionROISelection02.gif" width="224" height="174"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The selection box displays the region of interest that will be used in automatic segmentation. The use of word <em>region</em> here should not be confused with <em>region competition</em>. The region of interest is a rectalinear box, while the regions in region competition are of arbitrary shape and are defined by uniform intensity. We will now adjust the region of interest by dragging the sides of the selection box </p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Notice that the tool options control subpanel contains two buttons: <strong>Reset Region</strong> and <strong>Segment 3D</strong>. The former is used to reset the region of interest to the entire image. The second is used to enter the automatic segmentaiton mode of SNAP. </p>

<h3 align="left">Step 4. Familiarize Yourself with the Automatic Segmentation Mode.</h3>
<p align="left">When you press the <strong>Segment 3D </strong>button, the SnAP user interface changes considerably.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Artwork/ttRegionNewInterface.gif" width="532" height="447"></p>
<p align="left">Let's look at some of the new elements that have appeared:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The slice windows have fewer buttons and only show the region of interest selected in the previous step.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The IRIS toolbar has been replaced by a smaller toolbar containing only two buttons. These buttons are used to change the crosshairs position and to zoom and pan around the region of interest. The buttons are used in the same way as in the manual SNAP mode that you are used to, except that fewer options for setting zoom are provided. <br>
  </li>
  <li>A large panel labeled &quot;Segmentation Pipeline&quot; appears underneath the new toolbar. This panel contains the 'wizard ' used for controlling automatic segmentation. We will work with this wizard extensively in this section.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A button labeled <strong>Cancel Segmentation</strong> appears at the bottom of the control panel. You can use this button at any time to return to abort the automatic segmentation and return to the manual SNAP mode. <br>
  </li>
  <li>A pair of buttons appear underneath the 3D window. These buttons have the same functionality as the similar looking buttons in the 3D toolbox in the manual mode.</li>
</ol>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAttention.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>If the image slices appear washed out, i.e., have low contrast, use the <strong>Intensity Curve</strong> window to change the contrast as described in <a href="TutorialSectionViewingImages.html#Curve">Section 3</a>. </p></td>

<h3>Step 4. Construct a Region Competition Feature Image.</h3>
<p>Recall the concept of edge and region competition feature images from the last <a href="TutorialSectionIntroductionToAutomatic.html">section</a>.In this step we will construct a region competition feature image appropriate for segmenting the caudate nuclei.</p>
<p>First let's tell SnAP which type of the feature image we will be using:</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>Select the option <strong>Intensity Regions</strong> in the section A of the Segmentation Pipeline Wizard. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Now, let's estimate the range of intensities to which the voxels in the caudate nucleus belong.</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>Move the crosshairs around the caudate nuclei. Look at the values of the grey level intensity, which is reported in a box labeled <strong>&quot;Grey&quot;</strong> underneath the toolbar. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>You will find that the intensities in the caudate range between the high 40's and low 60's. This information is improtant for contructing the feature image. </p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>Press the button labeled <strong>Preprocess Image...</strong> This button is used to construct the feature image. The following window will appear </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="center"><img src="Artwork/ttRegionPreprocessor01.gif" width="243" height="229"></p>
<p>This window is used to specify the mapping between the greyscale image intensities and the values of the feature image, which fall into the range between -1 and 1. </p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>In the <strong>Intensity Region Filter</strong> window </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set the threshold direction to <strong>Below and Above</strong>.</li>
        <li>Set the lower threshold to <strong>48</strong>.</li>
        <li>Set the upper threshold to <strong>63</strong></li>
        <li>Set the smoothness to <strong>1.7</strong></li>
      </ol></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconTip.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>After you use the mouse to click on and move the knobs that are used to change the threshold and smoothness values, you can use the<strong> left and right arrow keys</strong> to move these knobs one value at a time. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As soon as you change some of the parameters, the SnAP slice windows will display the feature image instead of the grey image. As you change the parameters, the slice windows are updated immideately. If you uncheck the <strong>Preview result</strong> checkbox, the slice windows will only reflect the values of the parameters when you press the <strong>Apply</strong> button. </p>
<p>Our goal in setting the parameters is to make sure that the voxels inside of fthe caudate nuclei are assigned positive values in the feature image, and that the voxels outside of it are assigned negative values. There are two ways to check that this happens:</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td>Move the crosshairs around in the slice windows (the intensity region filter window will remain on top). Look at the values of the feature image, which are reported in a box labeled <strong>&quot;Preproc&quot;</strong> underneath the toolbar. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>or</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td><p>Check the <strong>Combined Display</strong> check box. The greylevel image is shown again, but the pixels where the feature image is positive are painted over with the color of the current segmentation label, as shown below. This is an easy way to make sure that the pixels in the caudate have a positive feature image value. </p>
    <p>Uncheck <strong>Combined Display</strong> check box to see the feature image again. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="center"><img src="Artwork/ttRegionPreprocessor02.gif" width="266" height="223"></p>
<p>The smoothness value determines the steepness of the mapping curve. It does not affect the sign of the feature function at any particular voxel, but it does have an effect on the smoothness of the snake evolution. </p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="36" valign="top"><img src="Artwork/ttIconAction.gif" width="36" height="36"></td>
    <td>When you are satisfied with the feature image, press <strong>Okay</strong> to compute the feature image at all voxels and close the intensity region filter window. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We are now almost done with the first step of the Segmentation Pipeline Wizard.</p>
<table width="80%"  border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">

<h3>Step 4. Initialize the Snake with Bubbles</h3>
<p>The Segmentation Pipeline Wizard should be displaying &quot;Step 2 od 3&quot;, as shown below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Artwork/ttRegionWizard02.gif" width="144" height="382"></p>
<p>This step of the wizard is used to position spherical bubbles to that initialize the snake, as described in the previous <a href="TutorialSectionIntroductionToAutomatic.html#Init">section</a>. </p>

    <td><p>Move the crosshairs such that the crosshairs position is inside of the right caudate nucleus in all three  slice windows.</p>
    <p>Press the <strong>Add Bubble </strong>button to place a bubble at the crosshairs position. </p>
    <p>Use the <strong>Radius </strong>slider to change the radius of the bubble.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>After adding a bubble, the SnAP window should look  like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Artwork/ttRegionAddBubble01.gif" width="266" height="223"></p>

<h3>Step 5. Run the Snake Evolution </h3>
<p>The Segmentation Pipeline Wizard should be displaying &quot;Step 3 od 3&quot;, as shown below. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="Artwork/ttRegionWizard03.gif" width="144" height="382"></p>

<p>The Snake Parameters window is shown below. This window consists of two parts. On the left is a control panel used to specify various parameters, mainly the weights of the propagation, curvature, and advection forces that were discussed in <a href="TutorialSectionIntroductionToAutomatic.html#Velocity">Section 5</a>. These velocities are displayed using a fixed feature image, and not the feature image that you are working with. Nevertheless, this image is useful for understanding the relative contribution of the forces to snake evolution</p>
<p>The snake parameter window also lets you save snake evolution parameter settings to a file and to load them from a file.</p>

<p align="left">These controls have the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The leftmost control is used to <strong>rewind </strong>the snake after it had been evolving for some time.</li>
  <li>The second control is used to <strong>run</strong> the snake until stopped.</li>
  <li>The third control is used to <strong>stop</strong> the running snake</li>
  <li>The rightmost control is used to <strong>step</strong> the snake, i.e., to run for a fixed number of iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Underneath the VCR buttons is a control that allows you to set the size of the step used in snake evolution. The larger the step value, the fewer times will the user interface be updated as the snake evolves. For small segmentations, it is advisable to leave the step size at 1. Next to the step size dropbox is a display that shows the current iteration. </p>
