  <p>This tool has been created in order to rigidly register different modalities 

    images. The method is made of two steps:</p>

  <ul>

    <li> pre-registration step, which is a landmark-based registration technique. 

      That method minimize the square distances between the landmarks.</li>

    <li>registration step, which uses the mutual information registration technique 

      implemented in the Insight Toolkit (www.itk.org)</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Is that the first time you use this tool ??? well, here is the steps to follow 

    in order to register images.</p>

  <p>1) Select a reference image by clicking on the &quot;Select Reference image...&quot; 

    button (upper left corner of the interface). Once you click on that button, 

    a file browser window will appear. Select the file you want to use as a fixed 

    image, and click &quot;OK&quot; when you are ready to go on.</p>

  <p>2) Select an image to register with the reference image you have previously 

    selected by clicking on the &quot;Select Moving image...&quot; button (left 

    side of the interface). Proceed like the previous step with the file browser.</p>

  <p>At that point, you have two different options. If you want to run the <i><b><font color="#FF0000">registration 

    only</font></b></i>, without previous pre-registration, follow the following 

    step.</p>

  <p>3) If you want to register the images, without running the pre-registration, 

    just click now on the register button, located in the lower part of the interface.</p>

  <p>If you need to run the <i><font color="#FF0000"><b>pre-registration</b></font></i> 

    on your images first, and <i><b><font color="#FF0000">then</font></b></i> 

    apply the<i><b><font color="#FF0000"> registration</font></b></i> on the pre-registered 

    data, follow the instructions below:</p>

  <p>3) If you want to pre-register the images before running the registration 

    method, you have to select four landmarks on both the reference, and the moving 

    image. To do so, click on one of the button labelled 'Landmark x', then click 

    on the image viewer on the rigth side of the button at the spot where you 

    want to place the landmark x. Once a landmark is set up, it will be checked 

    in the inferface. Follow the same protocol for each of the landmarks. The 

    'Go to...' button located on the right side of each landmark button allows 

    you to jump to the slice where the corresponding landmarks has been placed. 

    Once all the landmarks are checked (selected), you can click the 'Pre-Register' 

    button which is in the lower part of the interface. </p>

  <p>4) Run the registration by clicking the 'Register' button right below the 

    'Pre-Register' button.</p>
