OVERVIEW
--------
The following are instructions for validating the ITK filter XML files against
the Insight Code. For simplicity, assume that PATH_TO_SCIRUN represents
the full path to the InsightApplications/SCIRun directory.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Validation requires java and the xalan jar files (InsightApplications/SCIRun/Thirdparty/*.jar). 

VALIDATION PROCESS
------------------
All itk XML files are located in InsightApplications/SCIRun/ITK.
For each itk XML file, a temporary cc file needs to be generated. This is done
using java, xalan, and the XSL file in the SCIRun/Test directory.

The following is an example (assuming current directory is 
InsightApplications/SCIRun/Test) for the BinaryThresholdImageFilter:

   > java -classpath PATH_TO_SCIRUN/Thirdparty/xercesImpl.jar:PATH_TO_SCIRUN/Thirdparty/xml-apis.jar:PATH_TO_SCIRUN/Thirdparty/xalan.jar:PATH_TO_SCIRUN/Examples/CodeGenerator SCIRun.GenerateSCIRunCode Validate PATH_TO_SCIRUN/ITK/itk_BinaryThresholdImageFilter.xml PATH_TO_SCIRUN/Test/Validate.xsl PATH_TO_SCIRUN/Test/validate.cc

Next validate.cc needs to be compiled into an executable, validate

If validate.cc successfully compiles, the XML file is valid.

There is an example perl script (Validate.py) in the Test directory.  
This example must be modified to work on your machine.
