 InsightSNAP Release Notes
 Version 1.4
======================================

-----------------
1. New Features
-----------------


1.1. New in Version 1.4
-----------------------

1.1.1. New Features and User Interface Improvements

 -  New and improved label editor. You can easily switch between labels while in
    the editor and the interface for adding new labels is more intuitive. You
    can now delete labels.

 -  New and improved interface for intensity reparameterization. The histogram
    display is more visible and you have more control over the number of bins in
    the histogram and the scaling of the bars (linear or log). 

 -  SNAP remembers all settings associated with loading an image. This means that
    any image loaded previously can be reloaded without going throught the 
    wizard. 

 -  We've added File->Load Previous menu to let you load images quickly

 -  SNAP can now read DICOM file series (experimental support) and it can read 
    and write VoxBo CUB image files.

 -  SNAP remembers more image-associated settings from session to session. For
    example, it will remember the intensity reparameterization that you last
    used. SNAP will also remember the orientation ("RAI" code) that was last
    used to read each image. 

 -  New Image Information window is available under the File menu. It displays
    the size of the image and the current cursor position. 

 -  A color map feature has been added in the automatic segmentation mode. The
    color map lets you select different color schemes for displaying the
    probability map / speed image.

 -  Small improvements to the active contour 2D example dialog have been made

 -  A progress monitor has been added for the 3D renderer in main SNAP window.

 -  New buttons allow taking of snapshots in each of the SNAP image windows

 -  The tutorial has been updated to reflect the new features.

1.1.2. Bug Fixes.

 -  SNAP should crash a lot less than before

 -  The Left-Right orientation should be correctly handled by SNAP. You still
    have to supply the correct orientation ("RAI Code") when loading the image.

 -  The bug with the segmentation being shifted when using "Resample Region"
    option has been fixed

 -  3D window handles images with non-zero origin better

 -  Initialization bubbles have been fixed to be floating point

 -  Lots of other small bugs have been fixed!

1.1.3. Programmatic Enhancements

 -  SNAP and IRIS now share the sameset of OpenGL windows. This should prevent
    crashes on some platforms.

1.1.4. Other

 -  SNAP available as a universal (Intel/PPC) binary for MacOS at itksnap.org


1.2. New in Version 1.2
-----------------------

1.2.1. User Interface Improvements

 -  The ability to switch between 4-view mode and single view mode. Each of the 
    slice views and the 3D view can be expanded to occupy the entire SNAP window.

 -  A zoom thumbnail is now displayed when a slice view is zoomed in. The thumbnail 
    view can be used to pan the slice.

 -  User can specify whether he/she prefers to start in linked zoom mode or in 
    unlinked zoom mode.

 -  User can change the appearance of various display elements, including the
    crosshairs, the region of interest selection box, the window background and
    more. 

 -  SNAP automatically determines the image orientation (RAI) when that information
    is available in the image file

 -  SNAP remembers the last ROI used for each image.

1.2.2. Programmatic Improvements

 -  The level set segmentation pipeline has been rewritten, taking advantage of
    the stop and go functionality of ITK finite difference filters. This means
    fewer unexplained crashes and simpler code.

 -  A state-machine has been added to the user interface logic code. This
    machine automatically activates and deactivates UI widgets based on a set of
    flags. Rules such as Flag A => Flag B can be added to the state machine.

1.2.3 Bug Fixes

 -  Slice views update correctly when the SNAP window is resized

 -  Accepting a polygon now works for high resolution images.

 -  Fixed a crash on some systems when running edge-based snake segmentation with an
    advection term.


2. Known Issues
-----------------
 -  


3. Wish List
-----------------
 -  The ability to perform 2D level set segmentation in each slice view.

 -  The ability to export level set segmentation results as meshes or as floating
    point images.

 -  Ability to use different color maps in automatic segmentation mode.
