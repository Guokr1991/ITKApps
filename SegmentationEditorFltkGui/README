|  Watershed Segmentation |
---------------------------

These applications use fltk and VTK.
They work best if the source data is in the Meta Image format.

More extensive help for each application and its gui can be found by clicking
the "Show Help" buttons on the individual GUIs.


Segmentation can be done in 3 steps:
   1) First, smooth your data in a preprocessing step using
      the AnisotropicDiffusionFltkGui2D or
      AnisotropicDiffusionFltkGui3D.  This application offers
      GradientAnisotropicDiffusion or CurvatureAnisotropicDiffusion.
      Save out the data as a Meta Image (*.mh[da]).
   2) Next, run the WatershedSegmentationFltkGui3D application.
      Load in the smoothed data from step 1.  This application calculates
      a height function an allows you to smooth that also using a
      gaussian blur.  Save out your data as *.ws.  The writer will
      also generate a *.raw and *.tree file.  
   3) Last, manipulate your segmented output to produce labeled volumes 
      using EditorFltkGui.  Load your *.ws file which will load
      the *.raw and *.tree files.  Load in your original data used
      as the input for step 1.  


Additional Info:
Meta data does not support unsigned longs at this time.  That is why 
step 2 writes out a little *.ws header file instead of just saving it as
a *.mhd.  Also, the ImageToVTKImageFilter did not seem to support unsigned
longs.
