1. To build this application:

* You will need a recent version of VTK installed on your machine.  I suggest 
using the anonymous CVS checkout.  Earlier versions are not guaranteed to 
be supported because the API for event binding on the VTK Tk widget classes
has recently undergone a major change.

In your VTK build, make sure you include the Patented classes and Tcl wrapping.
You will need the Wrapping/Tcl directories from the VTK source tree.

* When you configure ITK with CMake, turn on the following options, which
will cause this application to build:

   BUILD_EXAMPLES
   USE_VTK 
   SEGMENTER_WRAP_TCL
   VTKITK_WRAP_TCL

* You may need to provide CMake with the VTK_BINARY_PATH, 
  VTK_INSTALL_PATH


2. To run this application:

 cd InsightApplications_SOURCE/SegmentationEditor/Scripts
 InsightApplications_BUILD/bin/WSTITK Main.tcl

 where "InsightApplications_SOURCE" is the path to your InsightApplications
 source tree and "InsightApplications_BUILD" is the path to your Insight build.


3. The rest of the documentation you will need is displayed by the program
itself.  Also see the documentation in the Applications section of the
www.itk.org website.


4. Report any problems to the Insight-users list (see www.itk.org).
