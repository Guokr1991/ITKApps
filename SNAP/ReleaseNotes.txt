 InsightSNAP Release Notes
 Version 1.2
======================================

1. New Features
-----------------

1.1. New in Version 1.2

1.1.1. User Interface Improvements

 -  The ability to switch between 4-view mode and single view mode. Each of the 
    slice views and the 3D view can be expanded to occupy the entire SNAP window.

 -  A zoom thumbnail is now displayed when a slice view is zoomed in. The thumbnail 
    view can be used to pan the slice.

 -  User can specify whether he/she prefers to start in linked zoom mode or in 
    unlinked zoom mode.

 -  User can change the appearance of various display elements, including the crosshairs, 
    the region of interest selection box, the window background and more. 

 -  SNAP automatically determines the image orientation (RAI) when that information
    is available in the image file

 -  SNAP remembers the last ROI used for each image.

1.1.2. Programmatic Improvements

 -  The level set segmentation pipeline has been rewritten, taking advantage of the stop
    and go functionality of ITK finite difference filters. This means fewer unexplained 
    crashes and simpler code.

 -  A state-machine has been added to the user interface logic code. This machine automatically
    activates and deactivates UI widgets based on a set of flags. Rules such as Flag A => Flag B
    can be added to the state machine.

1.1.3 Bug Fixes

 -  Slice views update correctly when the SNAP window is resized

 -  Accepting a polygon now works for high resolution images.

 -  Fixed a crash on some systems when running edge-based snake segmentation with an
    advection term.


2. Known Issues
-----------------
 -  


3. Wish List
-----------------
 -  The ability to perform 2D level set segmentation in each slice view.

 -  The ability to export level set segmentation results as meshes or as floating
    point images.
