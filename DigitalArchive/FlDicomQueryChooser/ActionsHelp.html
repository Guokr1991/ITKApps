 <br> The Action Buttons work on the Dicom Objects at all levels. Suppose you are at the Patient Level, selecting a lower level
      will work on all images relating to that group (such as a Study or Series or Image).

<a name="C1"><h3> MOVE </h3> It supports retrieve functionality using the C-MOVE message.  It sends query keys to an SCP(Remote Server)
                 and awaits responses.  It will accept associations( through client port) for the purpose of receiving images sent 
                 as a result of the C-MOVE request.The utility application cannot initiate the transfer of images to a third party
                 as yet.  
                 The retrieved Dicom Objects are stored at the location of the FlDicomQueryChooser working Directory.
                 The C-MOVE operation actually performs an image copy (no images will be deleted from the SCP).
                 FlDicomQueryChooser uses a configuration file to store your preferences between executions.
                 This file is stored as networkprefs.cfg (working directory) by default, although one is able to 
                 runtime load/save to other locations.  Note that under UNIX it is wise to chmod 600 this file, if you 
                 wish to keep your server information protected from other users.
                 To configure preferences, select Preferences under the Option drop down menu.

 <a name="C2"><h3> VIEW </h3> Selected Dicom Objects can be viewed by using the ImageViewer. This is a multi-dimensional image viewer. 
                 It displays one 2D slice or a MIP view of that data. A variety of viewing options exist.
  
 <a name="C3"><h3> LOAD </h3> Selected Dicom Objects are loaded into memory for use by an ITKApplication.A SmartPointer to the Memory location of the
                 Image is returned,so that users can continue to process the image using the ITK datastructure.A drawback is that the 
                 FlDicomQueryChooser GUI window must remain open(or minimized).

 <a name="C4"><h3> SAVE </h3> The selected Dicom Objects are loaded into an itkApplication and are written back as a user-specified Image Format and at a                  user-specified Image Location.
                 ITK  writes the following file formats: png, jpeg, tiff, bmp, nrrd, meta, analyze, DICOM, GIPL. 

 <a name="C5"><h3> DUMP </h3> This utility dumps the contents of a DICOM file (file format or raw data set) to stdout in textual form and the
                 pixel data is written as a .raw file (little endian, filename created automatically)  stored stored at the
                 location of the original Dicom Object.  
                 Attributes with very large value fields (e.g. pixel data) can be described as "(not loaded)".  String value fields
                 will be delimited with square brackets ([]).  Known UIDs will be displayed by their names prefixed by an equals 
                 sign (e.g. "=MRImageStorage").  Empty value fields are described as "(no value available)".
