     Anisotropic Diffusion Filter Application


WHAT IS THIS ?

This program is an example of a small 
application based on Insight.
It includes image display, GUI, and IO.

The program allows the user to load an 
image from a file, apply anisotropic
diffusion filters to it, visualize 
the results and save them to files.

This program creates 2 executables, 
AnisotropicDiffusionFltkGui2D and
AnisotropicDiffusionFltkGui3D. Input
data should be a MetaImage.



WHAT FILES ARE USED ?

liFilterConsole2DGUI.fl - FLTK GUI file

liFilterConsole2DBase.h
liFilterConsole2DBase.cxx - Base class
   for console containing information for
   reading, filtering and writing.

liFilterConsole2D.h
liFilterConsole2D.cxx - Class containing
   image viewers.



WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN IT ?

As GUI and visualization are not part of
Insight, external libraries are required
for this program. The GUI is implemented
using FLTK (the Fast Light Toolkit) that
can be freely downloaded from 
http://www.fltk.org.

FLTK is multiplatform and will run without
trouble on Linux, IRIX and Windows 95/NT 
and SunOS.
